This ruby script implements the basic wep decryption sequence, freeing the user from having to manually type all the `*-ng` commands and passing all the parameters such as the long BSSID, etc.

As stated by the aircrack-ng documentation, it should be used, of course, for educational or security assessment purposes only.

This script only works in Linux, and has only been tested under Ubuntu.
